# IODumpChaitraChallenge

🎉🚀 Hey there, fellow programmers! Are you ready for an exciting challenge? We are thrilled to introduce the IODump Chaitra Challenge - a 30-day programming challenge that will put your skills to the test! 🤓

Starting from the Marathi New Year, Gudi Padwa, and running throughout the Chaitra month of the Hindu calendar, this challenge will give you a chance to stay consistent with programming while also learning about Git and GitHub - the ultimate platforms for open-source collaboration. 🌟

Every day, we will give you a programming question that you'll have to solve and then post your solution on a GitHub Repo named anything you like or even use IODump Chaitra Challenge. But that's not all! 🤩 We also have an optional task for you to post your daily progress on your socials using the hashtag #IODumpChaitraChallenge and tagging iodump01. By doing so, you can learn in public, gain some momentum on your socials and inspire others to join in the fun! 🤗

But what are the benefits of taking up this challenge? 🤔 

Let us tell you:

1️⃣ Staying consistent with programming will help you develop good habits and enhance your skills. <br>
2️⃣ Learning about Git and GitHub will open up a world of possibilities for you to collaborate with others and contribute to open-source projects.<br>
3️⃣ Posting daily on socials will help you learn in public, build a network, and get recognition for your efforts.<br>

So, what are you waiting for? Get ready to kickstart your programming journey and take on this 30-day challenge! 🔥

The Challenge will start from tomorrow, so keep your Github accounts and repositories ready. 🙌
